1.might need to remove some enemies to keep playing game-increase addedcount
2.what if there is no unique spots left
3.sometimes the pieces crop up too close to the player
4.want to save the highscore so that after player collides enemy, user will be asked either to continue or try again
5.additionally can add level of games and the data could be stored temporarily to make it more interesting
